abstract = {Textile simulation models are notorious for being difficult to tune. The physically based derivations of energy functions, as mostly used for mapping the characteristics of real-world textiles on to simulation models, are labour-intensive and not guarantee satisfactory results. The extremely complex behaviour of textiles requires additional adjustment over a wide-range of parameters in order to achieve realistic real-life behaviour of the model. Furthermore, such derivations might not even be possible when dealing with mass-spring particle system-based models. Since there is no explicit correlation between the physical characteristics of textiles and the stiffnesses of springs that control a model's behaviour, this remains an unresolved issue. This paper proposes a hybrid evolutionary algorithm (EA), in order to solve this problem. The initial parameters of the model are written in individual's genes, where the number of genes is predefined for different textile types in order to limit the search-space. By mimicking the evolution processes, the EA is used to search the stability domain of the model to find a set of parameters that persuasively imitate the behaviour of a given real-world textile (e.g. silk, cotton or wool). This evaluation is based on the drape measurement, a characteristic often used when evaluating fabrics within the textile industry. The proposed EA is multi-objective, as textile drape is analysed using different quantifications. Local search is used to heuristically improve convergence towards a solution, while the efficiency of the method is demonstrated in comparison to a simple EA. To the best of our knowledge, this problem is being solved using an EA for the first time. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A lo largo de los a{\~{n}}os, las plantas han sido consideradas parte vital e indispensable del ecosistema, ya que est{\'{a}}n presentes en todos los lugares donde vivimos y tambi{\'{e}}n donde no lo hacemos. Su estudio es realizado por la ciencia de la bot{\'{a}}nica, la cual se encargar del estudio de la diversidad y estructura de las mismas. La disminuci{\'{o}}n y extinci{\'{o}}n de la variedad de las plantas es un tema serio, por lo cual ante el descubrimiento de nuevas especies, se propone una r{\'{a}}pida identificaci{\'{o}}n y clasificaci{\'{o}}n a fin de poder monitorearlas, protegerlas y usarlas en el futuro. El problema de la clasificaci{\'{o}}n de hojas es una tarea que siempre ha estado presente en la labor diaria de los bot{\'{a}}nicos, debido al gran volumen de familias y clases que existen en el ecosistema y a las nuevas especies que van apareciendo. En las {\'{u}}ltimas d{\'{e}}cadas, se han desarrollado disciplinas que necesitan de esta tarea. Por ejemplo, en la realizaci{\'{o}}n de estudios de impacto ambiental y en el establecimiento de niveles de biodiversidad, es de gran importancia el inventariado de las especies encontradas. Por este motivo, el presente proyecto de fin de carrera pretende obtener un modelo algor{\'{i}}tmico mediante la comparaci{\'{o}}n de cuatro modelos de clasificaci{\'{o}}n de Miner{\'{i}}a de Datos, J48 {\'{A}}rbol de Decisi{\'{o}}n, Red Neuronal, K-Vecino m{\'{a}}s cercano y Naive Bayes o Red Bayesiana, los cuales fueron adaptados y evaluados para obtener valores de precisi{\'{o}}n. Estos valores son necesarios para realizar la comparaci{\'{o}}n de los modelos mediante el m{\'{e}}todo de {\'{A}}rea bajo la curva ROC (AUC), resultando la Red Bayesiana como el modelo m{\'{a}}s apto para solucionar el problema de la Clasificaci{\'{o}}n de Hojas.},

abstract = {In many knowledge discovery applications, finding outliers, i.e. objects that behave in an unexpected way or have abnormal properties, is more interesting than finding inliers in a dataset. Outlier detection is important for many applications, including those related to intrusion detection, credit card fraud, and criminal activity in e-commerce. Several methods of outlier detection have been proposed, and even many of them from the perspective of Rough Set Theory, but at the moment none of them is specifically intended for multi-label datasets. In this paper, we propose a method that measures the degree of anomaly of an object in a multi-label dataset. This score or measure quantifies the degree of irregularity of an object with respect to the dataset. In addition, a method for generating anomalies in this type of datasets is proposed. From these synthetic datasets, the efficacy of the proposed method is proved. The results show the superiority of our proposal over other methods in the literature adapted to multi-label problems.},

abstract = {Digital world is growing very fast and become more complex in the volume (terabyte to petabyte), variety (structured and un-structured and hybrid), velocity (high speed in growth) in nature. This refers to as Big Data that is a global phenomenon. This is typically considered to be a data collection that has grown so large it can not be effectively managed or exploited using conventional data management tools: e.g., classic relational database management systems (RDBMS) or conventional search engines. To handle this problem, traditional RDBMS are complemented by specifically designed a rich set of alternative DBMS; such as - NoSQL, NewSQL and Search-based systems. This paper motivation is to provide - classification, characteristics and evaluation of NoSQL databases in Big Data Analytics. This report is intended to help users, especially to the organizations to obtain an independent understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of various NoSQL database approaches to supporting applications that process huge volumes of data.},

abstract = {Relational Database and NoSQL are competing types of database models. The former has been in existence since 1979 and the latter since the year 2000. The demands of modern applications especially in web 2.0, 3.0 and big data have made NoSQL a popular database of choice. Choosing an appropriate database model to use is an important decision that developers must make based on the features of a given database model. This paper compares the features of Relational Databases and NoSQL to establish which database is better at supporting demands of modern applications. The paper also brings out the challenges of NoSQL. Finally, the paper concludes by determining whether Relational Databases would completely be replaced by NoSQL database models. The findings revealed that, Relational Databases are based on ACID model which emphasizes better consistency, security and offers a standard query language. However, Relational Databases have poor scalability, weak performance, cost more, face availability challenges when supporting large number of users and handle limited volume of data. NoSQL, on the other hand is based on the BASE model, which emphasizes greater scalability and provides a flexible schema, offers better performance, mostly open source, cheap but, lacks a standard query language and does not provide adequate security mechanisms. Both databases will continue to exist alongside each other with none being better than the other. The choice of the database to use will depend on the nature of the application being developed. Each database type has its own challenges and strengths, with relational database lacking of support for unstructured data while NoSQL lacks standardization and has poor security. Modern applications in web 2.0, 3.0 and big data are well suited to use NoSQL but, there are still many applications that rely on Relational Databases.},

abstract = {Passively estimating the intrinsic material properties of deformable objects moving in a natural environment is essential for scene understanding. We present a framework to automatically analyze videos of fabrics moving under various unknown wind forces, and recover two key material properties of the fabric: stiffness and area weight. We extend features previously developed to compactly represent static image textures to describe video textures, such as fabric motion. A discriminatively trained regression model is then used to predict the physical properties of fabric from these features. The success of our model is demonstrated on a new, publicly available database of fabric videos with corresponding measured ground truth material properties. We show that our predictions are well correlated with ground truth measurements of stiffness and density for the fabrics. Our contributions include: (a) a database that can be used for training and testing algorithms for passively predicting fabric properties from video, (b) an algorithm for predicting the material properties of fabric from a video, and (c) a perceptual study of humans' ability to estimate the material properties of fabric from videos and images. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Cloth simulations are notoriously difficult to tune due to the many parameters that must be adjusted to achieve the look of a particular fabric. In this paper, we present an algorithm for estimating the parameters of a cloth simulation from video data of real fabric. A perceptually motivated metric based on matching between folds is used to compare video of real cloth with simulation. This metric compares two video sequences of cloth and returns a number that measures the differences in their folds. Simulated annealing is used to minimize the frame by frame error between the metric for a given simulation and the real-world footage. To estimate all the cloth parameters, we identify simple static and dynamic calibration experiments that use small swatches of the fabric. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we use our algorithm to find the parameters for four different fabrics. We show the match between the video footage and simulated motion on the calibration experiments, on new video sequences for the swatches, and on a simulation of a full skirt.},

We use a variant of Cusick's drape, which is used in the fashion textile industry to classify fabric according to mechanical properties. In order to produce a large enough set of reliable training data, we first randomly sample simulation parameters using a Gaussian mixture model that is fitted with 400 sets of primary simulation parameters derived from real fabrics. Then, we simulate our modified Cusick's drape for each sample parameter set. To learn the training data, we propose a two-stream fully connected neural network model. We prove the suitability of our neural network model through comparisons of the learning errors and accuracy with other similar neural network and linear regression models. Additionally, to demonstrate the practicality of our method, we reproduce the drape shapes of real fabrics using the simulation parameters estimated from the trained neural networks.},

As simulators improve, differences between these models become more important, but it is difficult to choose a model and a set of parameters to match a given real material simply by looking at simulation results. This paper provides measurement and fitting methods that allow nonlinear models to be fit to the observed deformation of a particular cloth sample. Unlike standard textile testing, our system measures complex 3D deformations of a sheet of cloth, not just one-dimensional force-displacement curves, so it works under a wider range of deformation conditions. The fitted models are then evaluated by comparison to measured deformations with motions very different from those used for fitting. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract = {How similar a virtual product is to a real product is one of the most important issues when using virtual simulation to develop real apparel designs. The first step to achieve high similarity is finding optimal simulation parameters for the desired fabrics. However, it is notoriously difficult to find an optimal parameter set that reproduces the physical properties of a specific fabric as closely as possible. It is because the relationship between the changes of simulation parameters and drape shapes is highly non-linear, not intuitive, and hard to be predicted even by experts. Therefore, users have to repeat trial and error based on personal experience until they find satisfactory results, which is time consuming due to the simulation time required for each trial. To handle this problem, we proposed a neural network model that learns the relationship between the parameter space and the drape space, then we presented a user interface that allows users to quickly explore the extensive drape space through simulation parameters. To validate our method, we provided our UI with experts in the fashion design industry and conducted user studies with them for qualitative evaluation.},

abstract = {Humans can visually estimate the mechanical properties of deformable objects (e.g., cloth stiffness). While much of the recent work on material perception has focused on static image cues (e.g., textures and shape), little is known about whether humans can integrate information over time to make a judgment. Here we investigated the effect of spatiotemporal information across multiple frames (multiframe motion) on estimating the bending stiffness of cloth. Using high-fidelity cloth animations, we first examined how the perceived bending stiffness changed as a function of the physical bending stiffness defined in the simulation model. Using maximum-likelihood difference-scaling methods, we found that the perceived stiffness and physical bending stiffness were highly correlated. A second experiment in which we scrambled the frame sequences diminished this correlation. This suggests that multiframe motion plays an important role. To provide further evidence for this finding, we extracted dense motion trajectories from the videos across 15 consecutive frames and used the trajectory descriptors to train a machine-learning model with the measured perceptual scales. The model can predict human perceptual scales in new videos with varied winds, optical properties of cloth, and scene setups. When the correct multiframe was removed (using either scrambled videos or two-frame optical flow to train the model), the predictions significantly worsened. Our findings demonstrate that multiframe motion information is important for both humans and machines to estimate the mechanical properties. In addition, we show that dense motion trajectories are effective features to build a successful automatic clothestimation system.},

abstract = {The 3D simulation of fabrics is an interesting issue in many fields, such as computer engineering, textile engineering, cloth design and so on. Several methods have been presented for fabric simulation. The mass spring model, a typical physically-based method, is one of the methods for fabric simulation which is widely considered by researchers due to rapid simulation and being more consistent with reality. The aim of this paper is the optimization of mass spring parameters in the simulation of the drape behaviour of knitted fabric using the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm. First a mass spring model is proposed to simulate the drape behavior of knitted fabric. Then in order to reduce the error value between the simulated and actual result (reducing the simulation error value), parameters of the mass spring model such as the stiffness coefficient, damping coefficient, elongation rate, topology and natural length of the spring are optimized using the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA). The ICA parameters are specified using the Taguchi Design of Experiment. Finally fabrics drape shapes are simulated in other situations and compared with their actual results to validate the model parameters. Results show that the optimized model is able to predict the drape behavior of knitted fabric with an error value of 2.4 percent.},
